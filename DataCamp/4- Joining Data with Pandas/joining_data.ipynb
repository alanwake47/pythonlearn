    "## Using outer join to select actors\n",
    "One cool aspect of using an outer join is that, because it returns all rows from both merged tables and null where they do not match, you can use it to find rows that do not have a match in the other table. To try for yourself, you have been given two tables with a list of actors from two popular movies: *Iron Man 1* and *Iron Man 2*. Most of the actors played in both movies. Use an outer join to find actors who **did not** act in both movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Iron Man 1* table is called **iron_1_actors**, and Iron Man 2 table is called **iron_2_actors**. Both tables have been loaded for you and a few rows printed so you can see the structure.\n",

    "Merging a table to itself can be useful when you want to compare values in a column to other values in the same column. In this exercise, you will practice this by creating a table that for each movie will list the movie director and a member of the crew on one row. You have been given a table called **crews**, which has columns **id**, **job**, and **name**. First, merge the table to itself using the movie ID. This merge will give you a larger table where for each movie, every job is matched against each other. Then select only those rows with a director in the left table, and avoid having a row where the director's job is listed in both the left and right tables. This filtering will remove job combinations that aren't with the director.\n",
